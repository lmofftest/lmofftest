    "Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code cell evaluate the expression (3*4)+5.\n",
    "Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation e.g.  This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.\n",
    "Then execute the cell to ensure the expression returns the expected output of 17.\n",

    "\n",
    "Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: Objectives: in bold font. Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, such as List popular languages for Data Science.\n",
